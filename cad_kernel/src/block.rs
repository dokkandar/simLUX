//! Blocks — named, reusable groups of dobjects (AutoCAD BLOCK / INSERT).
//!
//! A `Block` is a DEFINITION: a name, a base point, and the contained
//! dobjects stored in DEFINITION SPACE (their coordinates as captured at
//! create time; the base point is the handle they're carried by). It is
//! never drawn directly.
//!
//! A `BlockRef` (`Geom::BlockRef`) is a placed INSTANCE: it references a
//! definition by id and carries a similarity transform —
//! `p_world = insert + R(rotation) · scale · (p_def − base)`.
//!
//! v1 constraints (documented, deliberate):
//! - **Uniform scale only.** A similarity transform maps circles→circles
//!   and arcs→arcs, so every contained Geom transforms exactly with the
//!   existing `scaled`/`rotated`/`translated` methods. Non-uniform scale
//!   (AutoCAD's arc→ellipse pathology) is deferred.
//! - **No true mirrored instances.** `Geom::mirrored` on a BlockRef
//!   reflects the insertion point and rotation but the content keeps its
//!   handedness (a `mirrored: bool` flag is the B2 fix). Mirror a block
//!   you care about by exploding first.
//! - **Cycles cannot form**: a definition gets its id only at creation
//!   and there is no block-redefinition yet, so a block can never
//!   (transitively) contain itself.
