//! Session recorder — high-fidelity event tap for short debug sessions.
//!
//! Captures EVERY user action, state transition, doc mutation, and
//! memory incident during a few-second recording. Output is structured
//! `DbgEvent` records with: timestamp, kind-specific payload, and the
//! source-code `Location` of the caller that fired the event (via
//! `#[track_caller]` + `Location::caller()`).
//!
//! Two use-cases:
//!   1. **Bug repro** — paste the JSON dump into a bug report; reader
//!      sees the EXACT input sequence + the EXACT outcome at each step.
//!   2. **Algorithm extraction** — record yourself performing the
//!      intended workflow; read the resulting event list as a spec for
//!      a new command.
//!
//! Design choices for fidelity:
//!   * Snapshots taken at session start, on demand, AND every N events
//!     (default 50). Document is `Clone`, so the cost is one large
//!     memcpy per snapshot — fine at ~100KB/snap.
//!   * No global-allocator override for memory tracking. Instead the
//!     "memory incident" payloads include sizes the kernel exposes:
//!     `Document.dobjects.len()`, undo-stack depth, spatial-index entry
//!     count. That's enough to spot the bugs we hit in practice.
//!   * Event push is hot (≤1 µs typical). Snapshot push is the cost
//!     spike (1–5 ms). Recording is OFF by default — never runs unless
//!     the user pressed Start in the Recorder window.
